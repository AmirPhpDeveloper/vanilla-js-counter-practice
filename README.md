- Visual feedback for limit boundaries
- Keyboard shortcuts support (+, -, r)
- State persistence using localStorage

## 🛠 Topics Covered

- Variables and state management
- DOM selection and manipulation
- Event listeners for UI interaction and keyboard input
- Conditional logic and limits
- Browser storage (localStorage)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/vanilla-js-counter-practice.git`

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. Use the buttons or keyboard arrows (+, -, r) to control the counter.
